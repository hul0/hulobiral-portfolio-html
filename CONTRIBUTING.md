## 💻 Code Contributions (Pull Requests)

We welcome pull requests for bug fixes, performance improvements, or new sections.

### Before you start:

1.  **Check Issues:** Ensure there is an open issue for the fix or feature you plan to work on. If not, create one first to discuss the scope.
2.  **Code Style:** This is a pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript project. Please maintain the existing code structure, variable naming conventions, and file organization (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).

### Steps to Submit a PR:

1.  **Fork the repository:** Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository page.
2.  **Clone your forked repository:**

    * **Commit Message Convention:** Use clear, conventional commits (e.g., `fix: Resolve broken magnetic button effect`, `feat: Add project showcase section`).
