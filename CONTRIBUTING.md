## üíª Code Contributions (Pull Requests)

We welcome pull requests for bug fixes, performance improvements, or new sections.

### Before you start:

1.  **Check Issues:** Ensure there is an open issue for the fix or feature you plan to work on. If not, create one first to discuss the scope.
2.  **Code Style:** This is a pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript project. Please maintain the existing code structure, variable naming conventions, and file organization (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).

### Steps to Submit a PR:

1.  **Fork the repository:** Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository page.
2.  **Clone your forked repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hul0/hulobiral-portfolio-html.git
    cd hulobiral-portfolio-html
    ```
3.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name 
    # OR 
    git checkout -b bugfix/issue-number
    ```
4.  **Make your changes** and commit them with descriptive messages.
    * **Commit Message Convention:** Use clear, conventional commits (e.g., `fix: Resolve broken magnetic button effect`, `feat: Add project showcase section`).
5.  **Push your branch** to your fork:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
6.  **Create a Pull Request (PR):**
    * Go to the original repository on GitHub.
    * You will see a banner prompting you to create a PR from your recently pushed branch.
    * Provide a clear title and description. Reference the related issue (e.g., "Closes #123").
